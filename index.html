        Most people have a stigma that you need to 
        eat a strict, tasteless diet to lose weight.
        While it is a good idea to eat clean foods,
        you could actually eat nothing but junk food
        and <strong>lose weight</strong> if you consume less
        calories than what's called your <strong>maintinance 
        calorie intake.</strong> This would be incredibly difficult,
        however, because you will likely be very hungry
        since a small amount of junk food tends to have
        a high caloie content. You'll eat less than if 
        you were to consume the same amount of calories
        with a healthy diet.
